# Scientific Project Plan
## 1. Problem Statement
### Objective: 
Develop a decision-support system that predicts hospital stay durations and visualizes patterns to optimize resource allocation.
Context: The system should help hospital managers plan for bed capacity and staff allocation using historical and predictive data.
### Key Questions:
- How can we predict the length of hospital stays effectively?
- What patterns exist in historical hospital data (e.g., admissions, stay durations)?
- How can we visualize these predictions and patterns in a user-friendly way?
## 2. Hypothesis
### Primary Hypothesis: 
Variables such as patient age, admission type, and admission season significantly influence hospital stay durations.
#### Secondary Hypothesis: 
Historical trends (e.g., admissions by season or month) can guide resource optimization.
## 3. Methodology
### Phase 1: Data Preparation
Source: Use historical hospital data provided (cleaned dataset).
Steps:
Remove outliers and missing values.
Feature engineering (e.g., encode categorical variables, normalize numerical values).
### Phase 2: Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)
Analyze:
Distribution of stay durations.
Correlations between features.
Seasonal trends in admissions and stay durations.
### Phase 3: Predictive Modeling
Train models to predict STAY_DURATION:
**Baseline Model**: Linear Regression.
**Advanced Models**: Random Forest, XGBoost.
Evaluate with metrics like MAE, RMSE.
### Phase 4: Visualization
Visualize predictions and trends using D3.js:
Real-time predictions.
Historical trends (e.g., average stays by month, seasonal effects).
### Phase 5: Deployment
Develop a web-based decision-support system:
**Backend**: Flask API for predictions.
**Frontend**: D3.js and HTML for visualizations.
## 4. Deliverables
Scientific Outputs:
- Documented insights from EDA.
- Validated model results (with metrics).
- Key trends and findings from historical data.
### Operational Outputs:
- Fully functional web application with:
- Prediction API.
- Interactive visualizations.
- Deployment plan for hospital use.

## 5. Evaluation Metrics
- Prediction Performance: MAE, RMSE.<br>
**Mean Absolute Error (MAE)** : This is the absolute differences between predicted and actual values It shows the average error in the same unit as target. <br>
**Root Mean Squared Error (RMSE)** : This is the square root of the average of the squared differences between predicted and actual values.
- Usability: User feedback on the web interface.
- Scientific Validation:
- - Interpretability of results.
- - Reproducibility of findings.
