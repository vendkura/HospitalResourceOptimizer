## **Key Features**  
1. **Data Cleaning and Preprocessing**  
   - Handling missing values and inconsistencies.  
   - Transforming dates and creating derived features (e.g., stay duration, seasonal trends).  

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**  
   - Statistical insights and visualizations for trends in hospital admissions.  
   - Correlation analysis of patient demographics and medical conditions.  

3. **Predictive Modeling**  
   - Machine learning models to forecast:  
     - Future hospital admissions.  
     - Required bed capacities and stay durations.  

4. **Decision Optimization**  
   - Simulating resource allocation based on predicted demands.  
   - Providing actionable recommendations for hospital planning.  

5. **Interactive Web Application**  
   - Visualization of historical data and predictions.  
   - User-friendly dashboards for decision-making.
